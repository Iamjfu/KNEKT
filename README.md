<h1>This is a learning-purposes website called KNEKT</h1>

<p> I got the idea from http://briefbox.me/design-brief/mobile-network-site/ and I am doing it in order to learn front-end web development.</p>

<p>I will update this as the project comes to an end</p>

  <h5>
    Design a homepage, tablet and mobile layout for a fictional mobile network company called KNEKT, inspired by clean flat colourful design. The client would like to see custom icons and a big bold and colourful palette all within a spacious simple layout.
